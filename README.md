## Location Allocation using MIP

## Situation
Develop a Mixed Integer Programming optimization model for an oil spill problem to help strategic decision-making.


## Task
Find answer of the following questions:
How many and where to build oil spill response stations in Canadian Arctic? Will additional response stations improve coverage?

## Action
Build optimization model to find optimal facility location and allocation. This Optimization Model Maximize spill coverage while ensuring minimum response time, and sensitive areas are covered.

## Result
• 95% spill coverage
• Build 5 response stations
